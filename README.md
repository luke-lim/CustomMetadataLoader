#How to use this project

This is a fork off the metadata loader.  In it get rid of the application from the package.xml and added my own ant script.  Feel add your user credentials and rename it to build.properties.  if you have the migrationtoolkit installed deployment will be a snap.  
I created this because the existing project didn't deploy with workbench.

1 other caveat. if the "button" on the initial load screen doesn't work.  just setup the visualforce domain as a remote site and that will fix any of your woes.  Keyword visualforce domain, not the salesforcedomain.

v 1.0
Custom metadata loader is a tool for creating custom metadata records from a csv file. Create custom metadata types in your Salesforce org using Metadata API and then use custom metadata loader to bulk load the records. Behind the scenes, custom metadata loader uses Metadata API to bulk load up to 200 records with a single call. 

Custom metadata loader has a sample custom metadata type CountryMapping__mdt that allows users to map country codes to country names.
